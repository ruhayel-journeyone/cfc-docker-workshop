# Overview

Docker is a versatile tool for creating, deploying, and running applications through containers.

These containers allow developers to work in consistent environments, ensuring applications run the same everywhere.

Docker simplifies and speeds up workflows, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy code quickly.

It's great for both development and production, supporting continuous integration and delivery.

Docker also enables efficient use of server resources and is ideal for various environments, from local machines to cloud services.

It's especially useful for scaling applications and running multiple workloads efficiently.
