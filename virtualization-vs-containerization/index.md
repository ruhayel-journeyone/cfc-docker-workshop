# Virtualization vs Containerization

## Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system. It's often used to create virtual machines (VMs), where each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries, and libraries – taking up tens of GBs. VMs run on top of a physical server and its hardware through a thin layer of software known as a hypervisor. This hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the VMs and allocates what is needed.

## Containerization

Containerization, on the other hand, is a type of virtualization that encapsulates an application and its dependencies into a container that can run on any computing environment. Unlike VMs, containers share the host system’s kernel and do not require an operating system for each instance. This makes containers much more lightweight, requiring significantly less memory and processing power than traditional VMs.

## Differences

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers are more resource-efficient than virtual machines as they share the host system's kernel, rather than requiring a full operating system for each instance.
2. **Performance**: Containers have less overhead than VMs, leading to better performance and faster startup times.
3. **Isolation**: VMs are completely isolated from the host system, offering a higher level of security. Containers, while isolated, share the kernel of the host system.
4. **Portability**: Containers offer superior portability across different platforms and cloud environments, as they carry all their dependencies with them.

## Similarities

1. **Isolation**: Both technologies provide isolation for applications, keeping them separate from the host system and from each other.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Both allow for efficient use of system resources by allocating only what is necessary for each application or instance.
3. **Scalability**: Both technologies improve scalability, allowing for applications to be easily scaled up or down as needed.
4. **Automation**: Both can be automated and managed through various tools, improving deployment and management of applications.
