# User Namespaces

- **Definition**: User namespaces in Linux allow a process to have a unique set of user and group IDs, separate from the host system's main user and group ID mappings.
- **Purpose**: They provide isolation for the identity of processes, ensuring they are independent of the system's user and group IDs.
- **Broader Context**: User namespaces are part of Linux's namespace functionality, which isolates various aspects of a process like network, process IDs, and mount points.

## Relation to Docker

- **Enhancing Security**: User namespaces are crucial for Docker's security, as they allow containers to run in an isolated environment.
- **Root Privilege Isolation**: With user namespaces, Docker can map the root user inside a container to a non-root user on the host system. This means:
  - If a process inside the container gains root privileges, it won't have the same privileges on the host system.
  - Reduces the risk of a container escaping its boundaries and accessing the host system unauthorized.
- **Isolation Layer**: This feature acts as a protective layer, segregating containers from the host, thus enhancing security and stability.
